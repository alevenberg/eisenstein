# eisenstein

Time Spent Most on
- Figuring out the division algorithm. The problem was figuring out what the floor of a number is in the Eisenstein integers
- Plotting the points. Plotting the points and figuring out the translation in coordinates.
- GCD can be up to units only - as long as it is an associate it is good and you can pick a canonical sextant representation
- Bug: I was looking for a minimum but returned the element of the last iteration in best_candidate()
